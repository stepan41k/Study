Lena: Hey! Have you seen the announcement about that weekend street fair downtown? It looks pretty big this year.

Mark: Hey! Yeah, I saw a couple of posts about it, but I didn’t look closely. What’s going on there exactly?

Lena: From what I’ve read, they’re setting up live music stages, food trucks, an art market, and even a small gaming zone. I thought it could be fun to walk around on Saturday.

Mark: Hmm, sounds interesting. I’m just worried it’ll be super crowded. Last time it took forever just to grab a snack.

Lena: True, but this time they’re expanding the area. Plus, they’re adding more seating zones. At least that’s what the organizers claim.

Mark: Fair enough. Honestly, I could use a break from my routine. Maybe I should join you. What time are you planning to go?

Lena: I was thinking around 2 PM. That way we can enjoy the daytime events and stay for the evening music if we feel like it.

Mark: Works for me. Should we meet by the big fountain near the main entrance?

Lena: Yes, perfect spot. By the way, I checked the weather — slightly cloudy but no rain expected.

Mark: Good. I’ll bring a light jacket just in case. Do you know which bands are playing?

Lena: Yep! There’s an indie band called “Silver Pines,” an electro-pop duo “Neon Harbor,” and later in the evening a DJ set by someone named K-LINE. Their stuff is actually pretty good.

Mark: Oh, I’ve heard of K-LINE! That alone is worth going. If it gets too noisy, we can always wander off to the art booths.

Lena: Absolutely. And hey, they’re also screening short films after sunset in the open-air cinema area. Want to stay for that?

Mark: Sure! Sounds like a full evening. I’ll message you an hour before to confirm everything’s on track.

Lena: Great! Looking forward to it.
